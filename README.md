# SQUAD UP

## Description

SQUUUAAAD!!!! Made for gamers, by a gamer! Ready to become an apex champion? A Call of Duty king? How about just have a dedicated team to run the same games with? Well this is the app for you! This app was created for gamers to come and find other gamers who match their schedule. It's an open forum setup in which you pick a post (or create one) and comment with your gamertag underneath the one you would like to play.

## Purpose
The purpose of creating this was to not only get comfortable using an uncomfortable technology stack but also to create something that would hopefully solve an issue that people face. Personally, me and my friends always have issues connecting with each other due to the massive time differences, so it would be great to create a space that's easily accessible to find other players.
